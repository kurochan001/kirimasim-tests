# Nightly results of kirimasim-tests

The [nightly workflow](https://github.com/kurochan001/kirimasim-tests/actions/workflows/nightly.yml) of [kirimasim-tests](https://github.com/kurochan001/kirimasim-tests) writes this branch. Each night it runs every test of the suite's main branch with each simulator, adds the results to `history.json` and draws the charts below. A test matches when the simulator's normalized standard output is exactly its expected output; see the suite's README for what each status means.

Latest run: 2026-10-20 07:49 UTC, suite commit [`6bffc4a`](https://github.com/kurochan001/kirimasim-tests/commit/6bffc4a184134250ca4b934ef2b40af9961bc4d5), 2327 tests, [workflow run](https://github.com/kurochan001/kirimasim-tests/actions/runs/39387575855).
